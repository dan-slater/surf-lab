# surf-lab — HANDOVER

> ## SIM LINE, 2026-10-09: build-order step 4 (product renderer + surfer rig) DONE on `main`
>
> **Built, one commit and captured frame each (`docs/img/render/`):** `src/lib/sim/render/`:
> 1. `createRenderer(solver, { context, format, affine, theme, pixelRatio, look })` (`07a4886`): one
>    full-screen WGSL pass over the solver's `fields` and a new `flow` texture. B-spline eta, face lighting
>    from the slope, crest lines from a ridge fit, chart depth contours, land with topo lines, a wet-sand
>    band and a coast stroke. Theme tokens are the book palette and the approved wave-landing look (ink navy,
>    teal, cream foam, coral boards).
> 2. Line-art foam (same commit): three iso-lines of the foam scalar plus fine streaks carried by the flow.
> 3. `createFrontTracker(solver, grid).fronts()` (`70956e3`): a per-row GPU pass, 32 bytes/row of readback
>    every 0.25 model s; sections, tracked ends, least-squares speed, P4 `vp = c/sin(alpha)`, makeable.
> 4. `createSurfers({ zones, depth, grid, count, seed })` + `rig.ts` (`a519ab8`): the P6 rig and a seeded
>    lineup -> take-off -> ride -> kick-out/wipe-out -> paddle cycle; `/sim/cover?rig=1` shows every pose.
> 5. `Swell.groupiness/groupWaves` and `solver.rampFrom(level, { seconds, clock })` (`bc5bb6e`).
> 6. `solver.budget(ms)` with `Governor` (`1f6c6f1`): slow motion first, then `coarser-grid`.
>
> **Evidence:** check 0 errors, build ok, `bun test` 37 pass (new: fronts 3, budget 4, sets/ramp 2). GPU and
> CPU twin still agree (1.8e-4 m after 200 steps). On the 4090: 60 fps at 1440x860 and 2560x1440, a 6.25 m step
> 0.083 ms, render + tracker 0.27 to 0.34 ms a frame, a 10x cover frame ~0.45 ms of GPU. Budgets of 0.6 and
> 0.25 ms drop to slow motion, then ask for a coarser grid. Surfers over 400 model s: 19 rides, median 3.4 s
> and 40 m, ending in kick-outs, wipe-outs and waves finishing.
>
> **Honest limits (review):** (1) the sim breaks 10 to 30 m from the shore, so at a 4 km framing the surf
> zone is a thin bright band; the line art reads from ~2 km across and closer (frames 02-close, 06).
> (2) Peels are short bursts, so rides are short; at 10x a ride is on screen for well under a second, so a
> surfer-featuring cover wants 3x to 4x. (3) Budget timings without timestamp queries are upper bounds
> (round-trip latency); a frame-interval cap backs them up; untested on a real weak GPU. (4) Front
> thresholds and surfer tuning were fitted on J-Bay only.
>
> **For the app line:** the cover recipe is in `src/lib/sim/README.md` ("The product renderer"): a WebGPU
> canvas (or map-kit's overlay context) for `createRenderer`, a 2d canvas above it for `crowd.draw`,
> `budget.frame(...)` per rAF, `rampFrom(0)` on a new spot, `coarserDx` on `coarser-grid`. Dev route
> `/sim/cover`; tmux `surflab-dev` on 127.0.0.1:5181.
>
> **Next, if wanted:** timestamp-query timing when the device has it; surfers that pick lineups from where
> fronts are born (for click-any-coast spots without named sections); a cover framing preset per spot.

> ## 🌊 SURF-LAB + MAP-KIT: design settled, build via factory lines on zulzi (2026-10-08) — READ THIS FIRST
>
> **Goal:** turn the J-Bay GPU surf solver (`zulzi-gpu:~/surf-sim`) into a public web program
> with THREE doors on ONE engine, plus a reusable map package Leachie reuses for client data maps.
> Daniel chose ALL of it for the first cut (no phased scope), 2026-10-08.
>
> **The experience (decided):**
> 1. **Cover** — open it and a spot is breaking, full screen, no chrome; sets/lulls, line-art foam,
>    stick surfers taking off. Remembered spot, J-Bay default. Doubles as the second-screen idle.
> 2. **Dial** — three floating controls (Hs, Tp, direction) + spot picker + "today" (Open-Meteo marine,
>    no key, per lat/lon). Same sim with chrome on.
> 3. **Book** — the Surf Physics Review (`~/dan-hub/surf-physics-book/chapters/*.json` = the ONLY
>    text source) with the section's instrument beside the text; scrolling swaps the instrument.
>    Six instruments already exist as JS demos in `zulzi:~/surf-sim/making-of-research.html`
>    (P1 dispersion/shoaling, P2 Snell+break depth, P3 rays over the real coast, P4 peel angle,
>    P5 live 1-D NSWE, P6 surfer IK rig). Chapter→instrument map: swell→P1 + distance sorting;
>    breaking→P2 P3 P4 + the 2-D sim + Iribarren; catching→P5; day→shadowing/tide/height stats;
>    riding+turns→section speed + P6 on the peel front; board/fins→simple lift/AoA curves;
>    teaching→text only.
> 4. **World map** — globe (MapLibre + OpenFreeMap vector tiles), known spots pinned, pan anywhere,
>    CLICK ANY COAST → camera flies in, sim spins up on that coastline (swell builds from flat).
>    Coast polyline comes from the vector tiles already in the browser (water polygons at high zoom),
>    so no server/Overpass. Bathymetry = the J-Bay recipe generalised: signed distance to coast →
>    1:25 shelf inside 250 m, 1:70 ramp beyond, wet/dry land; per-spot overrides in a catalogue
>    (slope, reef angle, sandbar, named sections). Offshore GEBCO + finer national grids (NOAA, EMODnet)
>    where they exist, later. **Honesty line on the sim panel:** "modelled from the coastline, not surveyed".
>    Panning INSIDE the sim re-centres + reinitialises the domain (continuous coast-scroll = later).
> 5. **Later, shapes the architecture now:** forecast per spot + sim per spot ⇒ the map can show
>    which spots are working today. Design forecast fetch + catalogue for MANY spots, not one.
>
> **Tech (decided): web, not native.** Text is JSON, the demos are canvas JS, the only GPU piece
> already runs in WebGPU (Run C). A WKWebView shell can add a dock icon later.
> - **Repo A `dan-slater/map-kit`** (public, semver TAGS like site-editable): Svelte 5 over MapLibre.
>   Surf-agnostic. `<Map>` globe/pan/zoom, pins from `[{id,lat,lon,props}]`, side `<Panel>` for the
>   selected pin, named toggle layers, fly-to, an **overlay slot** mounting a canvas/WebGPU surface
>   registered to map coords, theming by CSS tokens (takes a client brand). Client use = same
>   components, different data: competitor pins with prices in the panel, radius ring, heat layer.
> - **Repo B `dan-slater/surf-lab`** (public, SvelteKit static → CF Pages direct-upload, e.g.
>   `surf.danielslater.dev`): `sim/` (WGSL solver module: grid, swell, bathy as inputs; bathy builder
>   from a polyline), `spots/` catalogue JSON (J-Bay first, ~20 famous breaks), `instruments/` (P1–P6
>   lifted out), `content/` (chapters copied at build from the book repo), `forecast/` (Open-Meteo,
>   cached). Routes: cover+dial+globe, book, per-spot. Palette: ink navy / teal / coral (approved on
>   wave-landing); book type Libertinus.
>
> **Solver sizing (read 2026-10-08):** Run C = `zulzi:~/surf-sim/webgpu/demo.template.html` (466 lines,
> ~230 WGSL): first-order HLL + Audusse, 192×512 @ 12.5 m, dt 0.12 s ×3 substeps/frame, relaxation
> wavemaker (θ0=150° math frame), N/S sponges, foam scalar, bathy baked base64 by `build_demo.py`
> from `out/A4-full/depth.f32`. Reference solver = `solver/swe2d.py` (MUSCL-MC + RK2, CFL 0.40,
> Manning 0.025; Boussinesq disabled). Run A fields in `out/A4-full/` (3.4 GB) = the parity target.
> Missing for us: bathy-from-polyline at runtime, swell as params, MUSCL/RK2 (optional), rendering
> (face light, line foam), surfers. Estimate: days, not weeks. A copy of the template is in the
> session scratchpad only; re-scp from zulzi.
>
> **Build order (all first cut):** 1 repos + map-kit skeleton + globe/pins → 2 solver module +
> bathy-from-polyline + J-Bay parity vs Run A → 3 cover/dial/forecast + spin-up transition →
> 4 rendering + surfer rig → 5 book + six instruments wired to current spot → 6 catalogue, deploy,
> tag map-kit v0.1.

> **HOW to build (Daniel, 2026-10-08): the tmux-orchestrator skill with factory lines ON zulzi-gpu.**
> Skill = `~/.claude/skills/tmux-orchestrator` (merged 2026-10-08; `factory.sh provision <host>`
> ships the fence, idempotent). Daniel's words: "get the skill from devboxv2 but use it on zulzi":
> devboxv2 holds the current fence/team tooling in `~/.orchestrator/` (team.sh, TEAM-FLOW.md,
> policy/, dated 2026-10-08); zulzi's `~/.orchestrator/` is older. Re-provision zulzi
> (`factory.sh provision zulzi-gpu`) before spawning; memory `tmux-orchestrator-merged` says remote
> boxes need re-provision. Nothing runs on the Mac. Suggested lines: map-kit, sim, instruments/book,
> with a manager line via team.sh. Remote lines cannot see the Mac; verify renders with your own
> screenshots on the control plane.
>
> **⚠️ UNCOMMITTED WIP:** none in code. This dir (`~/dan-hub/surf-lab/`) holds only this file; the
> repo is NOT yet created (no git init, no GitHub). `surf-physics-book` is a local git repo with NO
> remote — do not lose it; the app's `content/` build step reads its `chapters/*.json`.
>
> **Blockers / definition-of-done:**
> 1. Zulzi cleanup NOT done (classifier denied "interfere with workloads"; Daniel to run, see Next).
> 2. Done = cover+dial+globe+click-any-coast+sim+book(9 chapters, 6 instruments)+~20-spot catalogue
>    live on a public URL; map-kit tagged v0.1.0 and consumed by surf-lab via a tag pin.
>
> **Open decisions awaiting Daniel:** names `map-kit` / `surf-lab` (proposed, not confirmed);
> public hostname; whether the 2-D solver gets MUSCL/RK2 in the browser or stays first-order
> (watch-quality decides).
>
> **Gotchas:**
> - zulzi: Python 3.14 system, Taichi needs a 3.12 uv venv (`surf-sim/.venv` was deleted in July as
>   regenerable). WebGPU needs a secure context (serve over http(s), not file://).
> - zulzi is SHARED (gpuadmin has sudo; Nsuna local-dev stack lives under Daniel's own account at
>   `~/projectx-backend/docker-compose/local`). Keep secrets off it. `therapist-opensearch` must stay
>   up (Sunday 01:00 UTC cron `~/code/therapist-index/ops/collect.sh`).
> - Classifier blocks: credential-looking reads and stopping workloads over ssh. Use a scratchpad
>   script piped to `ssh host 'bash -s'` for reads; for stops, ask Daniel for manual permission mode.
> - Public bathymetry: GEBCO ~450 m globally; NOAA CUDEM 1–3 m (US); EMODnet ~100 m (EU); none for SA.
>
> **Next actions:**
> 1. Daniel runs the zulzi cleanup (one command, printed in chat 2026-10-08): compose `stop` the
>    local-dev stack (reversible with `docker compose start`), prune dangling images + build cache.
> 2. `factory.sh provision zulzi-gpu`, confirm `claude` auth there, spawn the lines.
> 3. Create both GitHub repos, scaffold, start build order steps 1 and 2 in parallel.
